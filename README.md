# DNBase - your line library

One stop solution to keep track of your genetic lines. No more copy/pasting from excel sheets, or accidental deletes!

## Description

The app aims to be a library where users are able to store their data of genetic lines used in their various experiments. It will store a list of active lines that the user is currently working on and a list of archived lines. This makes updating ethics application and collaborations more seamless.

### Technical Used

React, Supabase

### Wireframes

Your step by step planning sketch of your project, that you can post them as an image in here.

### User Stories

User will be greeted by dashboard with a summary of lines that are currently active/archived. They will be able to add a new line from this page.

After adding line, new data will be added into "Active Lines" page, where the current lines that are in use will be listed.

## Once no longer in use, user can click on "Delete" to remove the line from the list. They are also able to add a new line at the bottom of the table from the Active Lines page.
